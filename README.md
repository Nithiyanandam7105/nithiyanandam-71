# === Step 1: Sentiment & Emotion Analysis ===
# Load pre-trained models
sentiment_model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
emotion_model = pipeline("text-classification", model="j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base", return_all_scores=True)

# Function to analyze one message

        "emotion": top_emotion["label"],
        "emotion_score": round(top_emotion["score"], 3)

# Analyze conversation

# BERTopic to detect "thoughts" or themes in the conversation
